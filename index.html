                        <p>How many times have you been so frustrated by diet rules and restrictions that you caught a case of the “Fuck its” and found yourself wrist deep in a pint of Trader Joe’s Cookie Butter ice cream, and bowl of chocolate peanut butter cheerios?</p>
                        <h3>Here’s the truth: Those fancy fads are keeping you fat, soft, and squishy.</h3>
                        <p>Most programs don’t just make you bite off more than you can chew, they try to shove the whole meal in your mouth, and tell you to swallow.</p>
                        <p>The reason you’re not getting results is because you’re choking on complexity.</p>
                        <p>The reason your gut is still hanging over your belt is because you’re being suffocated by confusion.</p>
                        <p>You don’t need a diet with more rules than a game of Monopoly.</p>
                        <p>You need a plan of attack that you can take one bite at a time.</p>

                        <p>With the <strong>Chubby-to-Chiseled Blueprint</strong> you’ll never get more than you can handle.</p>
                        <p>Your nutrition will be strategically built around your lifestyle, your preferences, and your goals, so you’re not only eating in a way that’s going to melt fat and build muscle, but doesn’t have you confined by ridiculous rules or rigid restrictions.</p>
                        <p>All that is topped off with a straightforward plan of attack each week, with the specific marching orders you need, so you know exactly what you should focus on to build a body you love seeing in the mirror every morning.</p>

                        <p>Overnight promises, quick fixes, gimmicks, the “one weird tricks”...guess what they all have in common.</p>
                        <p>Not one of them work. You’ve tried them. Over and over; only to end up back in the same same place I did: Overweight and miserable.</p>
                        <p>How many times have you felt like an exercise program was too hard to stick to? Maybe it had you performing high intensity intervals, six days per week, until you passed out on the floor in a pool of sweat and your own vomit. Or maybe it had you doing something even worse than all that...like cardio.</p>
                        <h3>Solution - Ruthless Consistency of a plan built for you, your lifestyle, and your goals.</h3>
                        <h4>Are you ready to learn the Chubby-to-Chiseled secrets for losing belly fat, building lean muscle, and crafting a standout physique that nobody else has ever shared with you?</h4>
                        <p>You don’t have to hate your life in the process.</p>
                        <p>You don’t have to be miserable.</p>
                        <p>You don’t have to sell your soul and become a slave to the gym for a set of abs.</p>
                        <p>Seems like common sense, right? And yet we constantly try to stick with programs that are less enjoyable than being whipped by a rubber hose.</p>
                        <p>You can’t build ruthless consistency that way. The only way to create that habit, and build your chiseled physique is with a plan built for you; that complements your life without controlling it.</p>

                        <p>You know why websites, magazines, and Instagram accounts put out all those different workouts and meal plans? Because they’re easy to create. They don’t have to take into account the most important aspect of any fitness plan.</p>

                        <h4>Solution - A truly custom coaching plan built for YOU and the results YOU want to achieve</h4>
                        <p>If you want generic results, keep cycling through generic programs. If you want to love looking at yourself in the mirror every morning, feel ready to rip your shirt off at the first sign of the sun, or turns heads when you walking into a room, then you need something better.</p>
                        <p>You need a program built for you, not a drug-infused bodybuilder or someone without the responsibilities of family, work, or the complications of life.</p>
                        <p>You need a nutrition plan that changes as your life changes, not one that requires you to stay home Friday nights, or never go out to eat with your friends, family, or significant other.</p>
                        <p>And most importantly you need expertise to implement your plan, day in and day out, so you can finally stop spinning your wheels, feeling miserable when you look in the mirror or step on the scale, and finally start achieving the results you want.</p>

                            <p>“ Writer Derek Sivers famously intoned, “if more information were the answer, we’d all be billionaires with perfect abs.” If elite fitness came down to sets and reps, anyone who’d read a few books would be able to get clients to their highest potential; if getting fit were as simple as just going to the gym and executing, people wouldn’t need coaches at all. But neither of those is true.</p>
                            <p>In truth, helping people change their bodies is a kind of alchemy: equal parts art and science.

                  <p>Jorden is the very spirit of a before and after picture, made manifest and set in front of you, armed with all of the experience of having lived very different lives in very different bodies. The breadth of that experience grants him a type of wisdom and insight to which most can’t begin to lay claim.</p>
                  <p>Oft-sought and rarely found, Jorden has  deep intuition to go with his technical knowledge, and whether it’s adjusting macros or knowing when to apply tough love vs a gentle touch, he innately knows when he needs to shift gears to give his clients exactly what they need at any point.</p>

                    <p>Instead, you need a system. A system that gives you true nutritional freedom; to live your life and shed those extra pounds in the process.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="thirdWhitePartRedRightHedding">
                      <h2> And the Flex-Fast Solution is that system</h2>
                </div>

                <div class="thirdWhitePartParagraphContainer">
                    <p>The Flex-Fast Solution combines two of the greatest nutritional strategies known to man: Flexible Dieting and Intermittent Fasting. It’s the backbone of the Chubby to Chiseled coaching program. It’s the strategy I used to shed over 80 pounds of fat, and transform into a Rhino-Jacked human being.</p>
                    <p>It’s the strategy I’ve used with hundreds of clients to help them shed thousands of pounds of fat.</p>
                    <p>And it’s the strategy we’re going to use in your program to help you shed those unwanted pounds forever, uncover your abs, and build a head-turning physique.</p>
                    <p>Why does the Flex-Fast Solution work so well? Simple. Because it allows us to create a nutritional strategy that not only works, but will work for YOU.</p>
                    <p>With Flexible Dieting, we can craft a plan that allows you to eat your favorite foods, to go out to dinner with your spouse, or travel on vacation, while still dropping pounds and pounds of fat.</p>
                    <p>And on its own, Flexible Dieting is a deadly effective strategy. But when you combine that with Intermittent Fasting, you then create fat’s worst nightmare.</p>
                    <p>Intermittent Fasting is like injecting your nutrition plan with steroids. It will take good results and turn them into great results.</p>
                    <p>IF puts an end to one of fat loss’ biggest hurdles: Hunger. It allows you to eliminate feeling hungry, while allowing you to eat larger meals, that include more of your favorite foods, more often.</p>
                    <p>Intermittent Fasting also helps activate key hormones that are going to help you burn fat faster, and build muscle quicker than ever before.</p>
                    <p>Most importantly though, the Flex-Fast Solution delivers you a plan that complements your lifestyle; not controls it.</p>

                          <p>“Jorden helped customize my plan to get me to where I wanted to look and feel without sacrificing performance in the gym. My strength numbers stayed basically the same despite being in a caloric deficit and my cardio increased significantly. Guess losing 20 pounds helped that too.”</p>

                          <p>“Becoming a client of Jorden’s, I never felt “alone”. First, we worked on a nutrition plan together and he was there to answer every question I had, and never once did I get the feeling that I was asking a “dumb” question. Then came the workouts and that is when I found muscle groups that I never knew even existed. The workouts were tough, but not impossible and fun to do. Again, he was there any time I had a question about a rep scheme or a technique that I didn’t understand.” </p>
